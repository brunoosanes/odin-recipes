    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>6 <strong>cod fillets</strong></li>
            <li>1 tsp. <strong>kosher salt</strong> <em>(or to taste)</em></li>
            <li> 4 Tbsp. <strong>butter</strong> <em>(melted)</em></li>
            <li>2 cloves <strong>garlic</strong> <em>(minced)</em></li>
            <li>1/2 c. <strong>breadcrumbs</strong> <em>(seasoned)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the cream sauce:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tbsp. <strong>butter</strong></li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. <strong>cornstarch</strong></li>
            <li>2 c. <strong>whipping cream</strong></li>
            <li>1 c. <strong>milk</strong></li>
            <li>3 Tbsp <strong>parmesan cheese</strong></li>
            <li><strong>kosher salt</strong></li>
            <li><strong>black pepper</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400-degrees. </li>
            <li>Prepare cream sauce (see instructions below) and set aside, keeping warm. </li>
            <li>Spray a 9×13 baking dish with cooking spray and place cod fillets in the dish. Sprinkle with salt. </li>
            <li>Combine melted butter and garlic and brush over fillets, reserving any leftover butter mixture. </li>
            <li>Sprinkle seasoned breadcrumbs over fillets and pour remaining butter mixture over the top.</li>
            <li>Pour cream sauce in the spaces between the cod fillets so it fills up the baking dish and just the tops of the fillets are visible. </li>
            <li>Place in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes or until the cream sauce starts bubbling. </li>
            <li>When the sauce starts bubbling up, set oven to “broil” and broil for about 3-5 minutes or until the fillets start to turn golden brown. </li>
            <li>Keep a CLOSE eye on it to make sure it doesn’t start to burn. </li>
            <li>Remove from oven and serve with potatoes, rice, or vegetables. </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>For the cream sauce:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium sized sauce pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the cornstarch and stir for about 1 minute. </li>
            <li>While whisking constantly, slowly add whipping cream and milk until well combined. Stir in Parmesan cheese. </li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and whisk occasionally for about 10 minutes until sauce becomes rich and creamy, adding more milk, if needed. You want it to be the consistency of a thin gravy. </li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper, to taste. </li>
        </ol>
